### Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree
# Project 3: Create a Data Warehouse in Amazon Redshift

**imoprtant: you must have `.env` file with aws credential and `dwh.cfg` for creating cluster**

**the song data it takes too muche time running so i choose one directory from it`s3://udacity-dend/song_data/A/A`**
## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Sparkify needs a data engineer to create an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms the data into a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to gain insights into what songs their users are listening to.

As the data engineer, it is our job to create the ETL pipeline and data warehouse to support this analysis. We'll test our implementation by running queries from the Sparkify analytics team and compare their expected results with our results.




## Goals
In this project, we apply what we've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift.

To complete the project, we need to:
1. Load data from S3 to staging tables in Redshift
2. Execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.




### Datasets
For this project, you'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
  - Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

#### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`
`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, `TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

#### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`
`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

Below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like.
